## Shoe Catalog App

Shoe catalog is a simple online store called "Kasi Lifestyle". The online store is designed and created for Lubabalo who is my friend's brother. Lubabalo grew up in the streets and knows how it feels to be barefoot. So this application is designed to help kids in the streets by giving them free shoes by allowig people or sponsors that are kind and afford to purchase shoes for those kids. When in the application a shoe or shoes are purchased the shoes are delivered in the streets to homeless people.
